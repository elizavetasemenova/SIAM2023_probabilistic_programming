# Bayesian Scientific Computing and Probabilistic Programming: inside and outside the “black box” 

Bayesian methods are increasingly important in scientific computing where uncertainties and incomplete information play a role. This mini-tutorial will walk participants through the basic probabilistic concepts to give the understanding of how inverse problems and parameter estimation problems can be recast in the form of Bayesian inference, as well as equip them with hands-on tools for tackling such problems. The minitutorial will consist of two parts.


 

## Part I - [Daniela Calvetti](https://mathstats.case.edu/faculty/daniela-calvetti/), [Erkki Somersalo](https://mathstats.case.edu/faculty/erkki-somersalo/)
 
will begin with the explanation of the overarching Bayesian philosophy, followed by the fundamentals of modelling and computation.  Participants will be provided with basic programs in Matlab that will be tested on both static as well as  evolutionary time-dependent problems. By the end of this session participants will have overcome the fear of looking inside the “black box” of Bayesian inference and have laid a foundation for building their own Bayesian scientific computing codes.





## Part II - [Elizaveta Semenova](https://elizaveta-semenova.com/), [Maria han Veiga]()
will explain what probabilistic programming languages are in the modern landscape, and  demonstrate abilities of one of such easy-to-use software packages. This “black box” approach will equip participants with a tool allowing them to focus on the scientific problem of interest, while inference is being taken care of by the inference engine. We will show how to use Python libraries to perform exact Bayesian inference (using Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique) as well as approximate techniques (such as variational inference).
